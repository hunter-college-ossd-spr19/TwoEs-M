# Welcome

Eli - maintainer
Emma - contributer

## Section 2 

We learned how to fork a repo and set up a remote url so that we can push commits to our forked version and the original repo we forked from.

## Section 5

We learned how to submit issues, and each contributer (Emma and Mike) created one.

## Section 6

We worked on issuing pull requests to fix existing issues.
